# udp-latency
A tiny end-to-end latency testing tool implemented by UDP protocol in Python üìà. 

- **udp_latency.py** records one way latency.
- **udp_rrt.py** records two way average of latency, which has same arguments as udp_latency.

| -f        | Frequency of sending packets from clients, unit is Hz (number of packet per second). -f ‚Äúm‚Äù means constantly send UDP packets in maximum bandwidth | 1             |

## Time synchronization (--sync)

‚ö†Ô∏è Udp-latency requires the precise synchronization (same clock time) between server and clients. The basic idea for built-in function is from [IEEE PTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Time_Protocol) protocol.

![ptp](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/IEEE1588_1.jpg)

In the first 10 seconds before latency test, PTP events are exchanged per second for calculating **time offset** between server and clients. To aviod the impact of exchanging PTP packet on experimental traffic, udp-latency assumes that time offset keeps constant during the test.

Udp-rrt requirest no synchronization.



## Dynamic adaption (--dyna)

‚ö†Ô∏è  This method will slightly damage the periodicity. (Make periodic traffic sproidic)

Due to the processing delay is non-deterministic on normal operation systems as following figure, it is possible that the sending frequency is significantly slow than the expected.

![figure](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joan-Feigenbaum/publication/221655613/figure/fig7/AS:394046808838155@1470959488690/Processing-delay-distribution.png)

For example, when you send flow in 5Mbits, the real sending speed might be only 3Mbits as there is an implicit blocking time in `socket.sendto()` code. This is aviodable for scheduled traffic due to the accumulative processing delay from OS when volumn is high.

To deal with this problem, this code introduces a dynamic adaption approach to achieve expected bandwidth:

$$
NewFrequency = \frac{ExpectedFrequency}{DecayedRate} \\
ExpectedFrequency = \frac{CurrentFrquency \times RunningTime}{RemaingTime}\\
DecayedRate = \frac{CurrentFrequency}{Global Frequency}
$$

Where $CurrenctFrequency$ is the average frequency from program beginning to current time. $GlobalFrequency$ is the frequency user set with `-f` or `-m` argument. $RunningTime$ and $RemainingTime$ is the time from programming beginning time and time to programming ending time defined by `-t` argument respectively.

Due to locally test through `127.0.0.1` the precision difference can be bounded within 1%, the difference can be 30% without dynamic adaption.
