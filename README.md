# udp-latency
A tiny end-to-end latency testing tool implemented by UDP protocol in Python üìà. 

- `udp_latency.py` records one way latency.
- `udp_rrt.py` records round-trip latency, which has same arguments as udp_latency.

| -f        | Frequency of sending packets from clients, unit is Hz (number of packet per second). -f ‚Äúm‚Äù means constantly send UDP packets in maximum bandwidth | 1             |

## Time synchronization (--sync)

‚ö†Ô∏è Udp-latency requires the precise synchronization (same clock time) between server and clients. The basic idea for built-in function is from [IEEE PTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Time_Protocol) protocol.

![ptp](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/IEEE1588_1.jpg)

In the first 10 seconds before latency test, PTP events are exchanged per second to calculate **time offset** between server and clients. To aviod the impact on the experimental traffic, udp-latency stops sending PTP message during experiment and neglecting the time drifting.

Udp-rrt doesn't rely on synchronization.



## Dynamic adaption (--dyna)

‚ö†Ô∏è  This method will slightly damage the periodicity. (Small jitter contains with this additional bandwidth optimization)

Due to the processing delay is non-deterministic on normal operation systems as following figure, it is possible that the sending frequency is significantly slower than the expectation.

![figure](./Processing-delay-distribution.png)

>> For example, you with to send flow in 5Mbits by `-m` paramter (for a 100 byte packet in 1 Gbs linkspeed, you call `socket.sendto` every 2.5 us in Python interpreter), however the sending speed can be only 3Mbits during runtime as there is a uncontrollable delay in `socket.sendto()` code (so actually the OS call udp send around every 4.2 us). This is a common issue for a non-realtime OS when the application layer and MAC layer are not synchronized especial for high-frequency traffic. If your application is time critical, I would suggest you to try Linux Qdisc ETF scheduler with LaunchTime function with Intel i210 NIC, which is the best solution I know so far :)

To alleviate this problem here, this code introduces a dynamic adaption approach to achieve expected bandwidth:

$$
NewFrequency = \frac{ExpectedFrequency}{DecayedRate}, ExpectedFrequency = \frac{CurrentFrquency \times RunningTime}{RemaingTime}, DecayedRate = \frac{CurrentFrequency}{Global Frequency}
$$

Where $CurrenctFrequency$ is the average frequency from program beginning to current time. $GlobalFrequency$ is the frequency user set with `-f` or `-m` argument. $RunningTime$ and $RemainingTime$ is the time from programming beginning time and time to programming ending time defined by `-t` argument respectively.

Due to locally test through `127.0.0.1` the gap between realistic and expected bandwidth is bounded within 1%, the difference can be 30% without dynamic adaption.
